Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm jeparlefrancais, creator of Sea of Voices.

This is where I share my open-source projects.

My projects revolve around the [Luau](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau) ecosystem. You will find many Luau libraries but also a Luau code transformer called [darklua](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua).

I've taken on the challenge to connect the different Luau (and Lua!) environments together. For that, I have made it possible to publish Luau packages using npm. They're listed in my [awesome-luau list](https://github.com/seaofvoices/awesome-luau) with other projects from the community.

Sometimes I write articles:

- [Why You Should Use npm for Luau](https://medium.com/@jeparlefrancais/why-you-should-use-npm-for-luau-22113f54f1fa)
- [How to Create a Luau package](https://medium.com/@jeparlefrancais/how-to-create-a-luau-package-68d42093e7da)
- [React Components for Roblox Studio Plugins](https://medium.com/@jeparlefrancais/react-roblox-studio-plugin-a415893e4d2c)
