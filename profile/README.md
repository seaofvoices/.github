Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm jeparlefrancais, creator of Sea of Voices.

This is where I share my open-source projects.

My projects revolve around the [Luau](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau) ecosystem. You will find many Luau libraries but also a Luau code transformer called [darklua](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua).

Recently, I've taken on the challenge to connect the different Luau (and Lua!) environments together. For that, I have made it possible to publish Luau packages using npm.
